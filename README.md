# Invisible-Cloak
Imagine wearing an invisible cloak like in the Harry Potter movies! This project uses OpenCV and computer vision techniques to make objects of a specific color appear invisible in real-time video. The illusion works by capturing the background and then overlaying it where the target color (like a blue cloak) appears.
